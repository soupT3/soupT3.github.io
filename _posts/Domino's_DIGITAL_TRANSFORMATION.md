“It’s what we do!”

Digital transformation is everywhere! It is the incorporation of digital technology into all areas of a business resulting in rudimentary changes to how businesses operate and how they deliver value to customers. Digital technology is radically modifying the balance of power between customers and companies. When we think about a company that has transformed digitally, what are some of the obvious answers coming to our mind? Amazon, Google and Facebook, right? Of course, these companies have all changed the digital landscape in some way but who is the black horse? When we think about best web experiences, we probably never think of pizza companies first. However, Domino’s Pizza has re-invented its brand image and user commitment through unique digital strategies. It is an example of a company in a traditional sector that has undertaken significant technology-driven transformation. Their transformation journey is truly noteworthy.

Domino’s was having an image and a sales problem in the mid 2000’s. Their stock price hit an all-time low in 2008, going for around $3.00 a share. Customers complained that the product was “cheap.” The crust tasted like “cardboard,” and the recipe was unoriginal. The good name that Domino’s had in the industry was further tarnished by tweets. This is when Domino’s took ownership of their “cardboard-like” pizza and changed the recipe and announced it in their “Oh Yes We Did” campaign. They launched a new and improved pizza, changed the crust, sauce, toppings, and cheese considering the likes of the customers. It was a big, big shift! While Domino’s was taking massive steps towards improving their product quality, they also recognised the need for rock solid digital strategy to improve customer engagement and overall brand image that had been tainted. Their main objective now was to spice up the company’s image as well as its products. For this, the marketing and IT had to be closely aligned to communicate Domino’s digital transformation story very effectively to the users. To improve the brand image, it was crucial that there was a strong feedback loop through a well devised social listening strategy to improve product ideas, customer service and user engagement. The company also encouraged customers to share their opinions on social media. The floodgates opened, and the most popular opinions and suggested solutions got rewarded in the form of money. 

One of the success factors of Digital Transformation is flexibility. Flexibility as in, the ability to implement and make optimal use of the new and emerging technologies available right now to improve business operations and performance. Domino’s has been extremely flexible. Domino’s began a thorough overhaul of the company’s entire ethos, transforming it. It was transformed from a fast food business into a company imbued with programming hires, digital marketers, and other tech personnel. In short, they say that the idea was to create an “e-commerce company that happens to sell pizza.” To accomplish this, Domino’s entire corporate structure was altered — beginning from the top down — to focus on digital sales and advertising. This transformation was extremely critical to Domino’s at that time as it would determine whether the company would stay in the market or plummet further and probably be forgotten forever. In 2009, Domino’s pizzas ranked last in consumer taste surveys. As of today, its stock price is approximately $343.  

Another success factor for Data Transformation that Domino’s looked into is enhancing customer experience by all means. Domino’s embraced technology in all aspects to do so. One of Domino’s digital transformation’s key initiatives was creating a digital platform for consumers. Wanting to make ordering easy for customers, Domino’s made significant investments in multiple digital platforms. As the number of digital channels boomed, Domino’s started broad-basing its availability. The company was also amongst the very first players in the restaurant industry to experiment with pizza delivery through drones. They also introduced the Pizza tracker that made a huge impact. Domino’s Pizza Tracker allows it to seamlessly track an order from the oven to the consumer’s home. Consumers also have complete transparency as the process begins. After the online order is received in-store, it is tracked through the delivery line as it is prepared and on to when baking starts. When the pizza is out for delivery, it can even be tracked through GPS12. The company’s tracking apps provide detailed delivery information, reducing complaints. Quick fact: As of right now, pizza can be ordered from Slack, Facebook Messenger, The Company’s mobile app, On Twitter with the use of emojis, Google Assistant & Alexa as well as Smart TVs. 

Domino’s to me is the epitome of digital transformation with the right kind of digital-savvy leadership and culture. Doyle(the CEO from March 2010 to June2018) accepted the withering criticism and promised to work days and nights to get better. They indeed achieved what he promised. They believed that the tech innovations were an adoption to a tech company mindset that is nimble and viewed failure as a learning experience rather than a source of shame. They were extremely focused on delivering great experiences for their consumers that nothing else mattered. Domino’s commitment to digital has undoubtedly increased value to consumers by simplifying the barriers to ordering and delivering their pizza. They covered most of the aspects of Digital transformation such as moving IT and marketing closer, incorporating flexibility, enhancing user experience and continuous improvement. They made their emphasis on the fact that Domino’s is not just in the pizza-making business, but in the pizza-delivery business, which means it has to be in the technology business too. They are a company that is never finished with its digital transformation and is continually experimenting to improve the pizza experience.  Domino’s went all in, and taught us that in a world of hyper-competition and nonstop disruption, playing it safe is the riskiest course of all.
