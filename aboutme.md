Hey!! 
So, my name is Supriya Tiwari, and I'm an MSIS grad student at Santa Clara University. I was introduced to automation and management from a young age, and I can confidently assert that I can seamlessly work with new technologies that have a steep learning curve. My keen interest in digging deeper into trends and patterns has propelled me towards my growth in the field of data and my absolute favourite skills at the moment are Python, SQL and Tableau. 
 
I am currently looking for an Internship role for Summer 2021! 


*What else do you need to know?*

Well, having completed schooling from 3 different countries, I have spent a considerable amount of my personal and academic life interacting with people from different cultures and countries. Overall, I have changed over 6 schools and I believe I have the unique ability to collaborate with people from different backgrounds without any communication gaps making me extremely flexible and adaptable.
